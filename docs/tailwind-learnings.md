### How to make a div visible only to larger screens  and another div only to mobile using tailwind css

Tailwind CSS provides utility classes that help you control the visibility of elements based on the screen size. These are known as responsive design classes, which use the format: `{screen size}:{utility}`. Here's how you can make a `div` visible only on larger screens and another `div` only on mobile:

1. **Visible Only on Larger Screens**:
   Use the `hidden` utility class to hide the element by default and then use `{screen size}:block` or `{screen size}:flex` (depending on your layout needs) to make it visible on larger screens.

   Example for larger screens (typically `md` for medium screens and up):
   ```html
   <div class="hidden md:block">
     <!-- Content for larger screens goes here -->
   </div>
   ```

   In this example, the `div` will be hidden on small screens and visible from medium-sized screens and up (`md` corresponds to a minimum width of 768px by default).

2. **Visible Only on Mobile**:
   Use the `{screen size}:hidden` utility to hide the element when the screen size reaches a certain breakpoint.

   Example for mobile screens (up to `md`):
   ```html
   <div class="md:hidden">
     <!-- Content for mobile screens goes here -->
   </div>
   ```

   Here, the `div` will be visible on small screens but hidden on medium-sized screens and larger.

Remember that Tailwind uses a mobile-first design approach, meaning that unless you specify a screen size, the styles apply from the smallest screen size up. When you specify a screen size, the styles apply to that size and up.

The breakpoints for screen sizes in Tailwind CSS are, by default:

- `sm`: 640px
- `md`: 768px
- `lg`: 1024px
- `xl`: 1280px
- `2xl`: 1536px

You can customize these breakpoints in the Tailwind config file if needed.
